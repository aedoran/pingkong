# Official Bitly Ping Pong "Rules"

* Shots off the wall are most definitely in
* Normal game is to 11, changing serve every 2 points
* Basically anything is fair game on serve (just needs to hit your side first)
* First serve determined by an initial rally (of at least 4 shots)
* No suckers' serve
* Loser submits score to the website, or winner can do it on the Surface tablet
